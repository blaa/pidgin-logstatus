*** Buddy status history plugin.

See a "TODO" file for the most irritating bugs, best before using this
plugin at all. There's NO WARRANTY see COPYING file.

*** Installation:
This is a source distribution and requires a working compiler toolchain.

You can edit logstatus.c and change two flags. 
DEBUG and ONLY_OPENED_CONVERSATIONS. 

Compilation:
$ make

On Windows you can try:
> make -f Makefile.mingw

Then place compiled .so (dll) file inside ~/.purple/plugins:
$ cp logstatus.so ~/.purple/plugins/

Or instead try installing system-wide:
$ make install


Then enable plugin in Pidgin. It's visible under the name:
"Buddy Status History".
